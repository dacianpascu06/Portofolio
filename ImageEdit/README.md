	This is my first personal project, I have created a C program that edits photo. bmp.h contains the functions that reades from a bmp photo and writes to one, converting the photo to a triple pointer that holds the values of the pixels in the RBG format. Imagine processing.c contains the functions that do as followed :
	flip_horizontal - flips the image	
	rotate left - rotates the image to the left
	crop - crops the image
	extend - extends the image with a border
	paste - pastes another image on the current one
	apply_filter - blurs the image

	Interactive.c
	It is an interactive c program that can load and store images and filters. You can type commands in the cli
	and the program will run the functions.
